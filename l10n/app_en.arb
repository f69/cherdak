  "ideaHeader": "How did the idea come about?",
  "ideaText": "The idea for the project arose unexpectedly. Artem and Valeryan (founders of the ilavista company, programmer and marketer, respectively) were walking around Minsk and went to an exhibition on Oktyabrskaya Street - they saw the prices of the works and were a little surprised.\n\nWe decided to look for the cost on the Internet. No worthy platforms were found. There were only online stores selling printed paintings, a union of artists, or groups on social networks. The question arose, where to look for talented but not yet famous guys who are ready to make money from their creativity?",

The popularity of the project quickly grew: “In a week, 50 authors registered 250 works. The project first appeared on the Internet in 2016.\n\nDali's Attic took part in competitions: My Business from ONT, BizTech BSU StartUp, 76th Startup Battle from startup.network, and Investor Day from Startup School We also introduced the project to art galleries, museums and art spaces that still support us. We were especially pleasantly greeted at BGAI, because many of the users are current, past or future students.",
  "implementationText2": "* This was perhaps our best decision, since by presenting the project to the public we received a huge amount of feedback, comments, and suggestions from talented entrepreneurs, specialists and professionals."
